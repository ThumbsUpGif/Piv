                <h2>An overlooked cause</h2>
                <p>When I started on this college project in October 2021, most of Europe had successfully fought off
                    repeated waves of the pandemic and had eased restrictions to the point where life started to feel
                    like normal again. Yet at that same point of time <strong>only 4% of Africans had received a vaccine
                        shot.</strong> In 2021, the only way a private individual in Europe could make a direct
                    financial contribution towards the problem was through donations to the Covid-19 Solidarity Response
                    Fund, an organisation that was for the most part unknown to a Western audience. <br><br> If
                    successful in increasing awareness of the fund, this project could make a small, but still
                    meaningful, difference.</p>

                <h2>Qualitative survey</h2>
                <p>I was enrolled in college at the time and only had a couple of weeks to do the assignment, so fellow
                    students were my most readily available source for user insights. I therefore based the project on
                    <strong>20 - 30 year olds</strong> as the intended target audience for my campaign website.

                    I created a Google questionnaire with a view to capture their living situations, their news- and
                    social media habits, their experiences with charitable giving and their attitudes to <abbr title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</abbr> in
                    general.</p>

            <div class="charity__insights__paragraph">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>
                    When sorting through the responses I was pleasantly surprised to discover young people with
                    dedication and generosity, who gave to charity even when student life meant living on limited
                    budgets.
                    <br><br>
                    More challenging to this project however was their preferences when it came to <abbr title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</abbr>s. <strong>My
                        respondents preferred smaller idealistic units to well-established blue-chip organisations â€“
                        passion and personal conviction over expertise and technocracy.</strong> Their amazing work
                    notwithstanding, one could argue that the Covid-19 Solidarity Response does not match well with
                    these expectations given their somewhat anonymous existence under the aegis of the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> and other <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>
                    agencies.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, I took some cues from Sara Wachter-Boettchâ€™s book 'Technically Wrong', and added a final
                    section of questions about my recipientsâ€™ experiences (and possible trauma) related to the pandemic.
                    I found that a third of my respondents preferred to avoid the topic altogether, and among the rest
                    there were several who had experienced significant worries and even bouts of depression.
                    <strong>Finding the right tone became crucial to the project.</strong>

            I had created a dilemma for myself; fighting the pandemic required a large and highly professional

                    I used the mid-fi wireframes as an opportunity to explore three distinct aesthetic styles. I
                    conducted a series of user interviews, then returned with prototypes that could be tested with Figma
                    and Figma Mirror.
                    <br><br>
                    Briefly explained, the first style attempted to represent the closest thematic link to the upbeat
                    tone and saturated colours of social media, the medium through which one would most likely promote
                    the cause to the target audience. The second option was based on the warm rich tones often
                    associated with an African aesthetic, without making it too obvious, and the strong typographic
                    contrasts reflect the visual language of news media from where the target audience received their
                    updates on the pandemic. The final (and least popular) style sought to reflect the fight against the
                    pandemic as a medical and scientific endeavour.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The seriousness of the subject matter led my test users to opt for the dark background with
                        high contrast text.</strong>

                    For all three themes I used Creative Commons licensed material from African photographers. I chose
                    motifs featuring subjects in the same age bracket as the target audience, in relatable poses and
                    fashionable clothes, thus <strong>carefully avoiding the many overused visual clichÃ©s applied to
                        Africa</strong> that one typically sees in <abbr title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</abbr> marketing material. Turning them into grayscale
                    was a pragmatic decision, bringing visual cohesion to material shot by photographers with widely
                    different styles and techniques.

                    Given the above mentioned discrepancy between the target groupâ€™s ideals and the fundâ€™s public
                    profile, getting the text right proved more challenging than I had expected. When writing I ended up
                    relying heavily on my personas; Julie who prized immediate action and emotional involvement, Marte
                    who expected to see quantifiable results, and Henrik who always preferred to focus on the situation
                    on the ground rather than the <abbr title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</abbr> in question. The result was <strong>a text written with an
                        emphasis on the second person singular</strong>, attempting to draw parallels between their own
                    experience of the pandemic and that of their same age counterparts on the African continent. To
                    loosen the dry feel of the factual information I posted a thread on Reddit soliciting stories about
                    the pandemic from young African Reddit users and included a couple of their answers in the project.
