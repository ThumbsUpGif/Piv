                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>
                        I received the Oslo tourism app brief in August 2020, a time when Oslo was effectively closed to
                        foreign tourists and access to sites of interest was significantly restricted due to pandemic
                        guidelines. This left me with two possible directions. I could base the concept on usersâ€™
                        experiences before the pandemic, with a view to make an app that would become valid again a soon
                        as restrictions lifted. Or I could confine my research to the challenges of present moment and
                        hope that this extreme situation would create unique insights that could prove useful also when
                        the pandemic restrictions lifted.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose the latter, to make it <strong>a â€˜domestic tourist during a pandemicâ€™ project</strong>,
                        and set about interviewing Oslo based friends, family, and colleagues over the phone, asking
                        them about their current urban leisure options. During much of 2020 this was essentially
                        confined to going for walks or hang out in parks and public squares.

                    <h2>User interviews</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through research I discovered several sources of frustration across different demographics, but
                        most interestingly <strong>I found that parents of young children could spend quite a bit of
                            time searching for suitable playgrounds.</strong> As playgrounds can be owned and maintained
                        by a wide range of different organisations, there is no central registry in which they can be
                        found, and more importantly from whom information about them can be channelled to services such
                        as Google or Four Square. That doesnâ€™t mean that playgrounds are impossible to find, after all
                        there are plenty of them around, but itâ€™s difficult to know in advance if they are any good.
                        According to my research, the best ways a parent could approach this matter would be to make a
                        visual assessment from Google Mapsâ€™ satellite view or street view or, more commonly, network
                        with other parents. This networking could be directly, through for example WhatsApp groups, or
                        indirectly by searching online and discovering blog posts or social media comments.

                    <p>
                        This project seeks to help parents of young children by designing an app built upon <strong>a
                            map indexed registry of good playgrounds</strong> â€“ a registry that will be structured
                        around the usersâ€™ needs. It aims to let parents exchange experiences through a review and rating
                        system and encourages them to enrich the information available through submitting their own
                        photographs. Lastly, I have added an editorial dimension, where articles and copy have the
                        potential to enhance engagement as well as potentially opening avenues to monetize the project.

                    <p>Following the research and concept development stages, the project moved to a pen and paper
                        stage. The first set of drawings were rather crude sketches of the appâ€™s main screens. These
                        were then loaded into the Marvel app for testing, allowing me to work out the most basic
                        information flows and seek out immediate user feedback.
                        <br><br>
                        For the second and third iterations of the project I moved the sketching routine to dot paper
                        and took care to consider the full length of the scrollable app screen.

                        Where the concept and sketching phases had uncovered an abundance of ideas for what the app
                        could be the lo-fi wireframes presented some harder decisions in terms of what categories of
                        information would be given priority, in what order the information ought to be presented, and
                        what should be cut out entirely. The first two iterations were user tested with the Adobe XD
                        app, but by the third iteration the <strong>Figma Mirror</strong> app had improved to the point
                        where it could support impromptu user testing using a phone only.

                        My initial concept was quick and straightforward, where the app would open directly in map view
                        allowing the user to immediately see which playgrounds were within walking distance from their
                        present location. However, most tourism and sightseeing apps are based on <strong>a central core
                            of editorialised content</strong>, allowing the user to plan their itineraries well in
                        advance. Later iterations therefore explored the scope of what this content could be and how
                        this could be made helpful to the target demographic.

                        When working on the mid-fi wireframes I started using real data, while also playing around with
                        various layouts and stylistic directions I had been wanting to try out. This introduced
                        discipline to the process. <strong>The need to convey information from real playgrounds would
                            regularly
                            present challenges to my design ideas</strong>, compelling me to quickly throw out any
                        sources of
                        inspiration that could not be applied in practice.

                        Then followed a more intensive phase as I developed the feedback from the mid-fi wireframes into
                        a hi-fi prototype with all relevant screens and functionality. Running frequent iterations, I
                        tested the app on an ongoing basis with just a couple of dedicated users.
